FILE OPERATION TIMING:
======================

Synchronous (blocking):
  - save_file("file.txt", "content")
    → 20ms blocked, no UI updates

Asynchronous (non-blocking):
  - await save_file_async("file.txt", "content")
    → 20ms total, yields every 512 bytes
    → Keyboard can be scanned every 10ms during save!

Batching Benefits:
  - User types 5 characters in 500ms
  - Without batching: 5 saves × 20ms = 100ms I/O
  - With batching: 1 save × 20ms = 20ms I/O
  - Reduction: 80% less flash wear!


MEMORY EFFICIENCY:
==================

Reading large file (20KB):
  - Sync: Load entire file into RAM at once (20KB buffer)
  - Async: Load in 512-byte chunks (512B buffer)
  - Memory savings: 19.5KB!

This is critical on Pico 2W with limited RAM (264KB total).
