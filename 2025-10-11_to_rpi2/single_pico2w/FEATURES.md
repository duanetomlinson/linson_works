### File Format
```
First page content here with word wrapping.
This continues until explicit page break.
---
Second page starts here.
More content on page 2.
---
Third page and so on.
```

### Text Layout Process
```
Text Buffer (chars)
      ↓
calculate_lines() → Word wrap to screen width
      ↓
get_screen_pages() → Split into screen-sized pages
      ↓
render_text_page() → Draw to display buffer
      ↓
Display Refresh (Core 1) → Update e-ink
```
